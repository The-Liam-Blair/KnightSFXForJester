# KnightSFXForJester

### Replaces the Jester's sound effects with sounds and music from Deltarune's ROARING KNIGHT.

### Replaced sound effects:
- 'Pop Goes the Weazel' music -> Build-up portion of Black Knife, looped (Altered to continously speed up and increase in pitch as the song continues).
- Scream / Chase SFX -> Remaining portion of Black Knife, looped.
- Popping out of the box SFX -> Knight roar SFX.
- Employee killed SFX -> Swoon SFX.

### Credits
- Black Knife OST, and audio samples for the roar and swoon SFX extracted from the game Deltarune, all created by Toby Fox.
